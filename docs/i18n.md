## Internationalization

The application provides localization support. It uses the expo `Localization` module to provide this feature.

This application handles only Swedish and English translation. In order to add support for another language first add a file in the `i18n/locales` directory. The name of the file can be `ISO 639-1 Code` for a language. Such as:
```
en.js
sv.js
fr.js
de.js
```

The file will contain a similar object with all the properties present in the `i18n/locales/en.js` file and the respective translation of the desired language as values.

After that in the `i18n/index.js` file import the new translation object form the respective file and add a new property in the translations object like following.
```
import en from './locales/en'
import sv from './locales/sv'
import fr from './locales/fr'
import de from './locales/de'

I18n.translations = {
  en,
  sv,
  fr,
  de
}
```

That's it. Adding new language support is done.
